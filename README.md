## Jenkins CI Jobs

The repository contains the Jenkinfiles used to build documentation previews for Boost and The C++ Alliance.  

In addition to doc previews there may also be benchmarking automation and other types of CI jobs.

See the [jenkinsfiles](jenkinsfiles) directory for the file content.   

The [scripts](scripts) directory will have (optional) scripts used by the jobs.  

The [docs](docs) directory will cover more information about how the server was installed and about specific target repositories and jobs.
