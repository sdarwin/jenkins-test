## Jenkins CI Jobs

A repository containing the Jenkinfiles used to build documentation previews for Boost and The C++ Alliance.  

In addition to doc previews, there may also be benchmarking automation and other types of CI jobs.

The [jenkinsfiles](jenkinsfiles) directory here contains the Jenkinsfiles.  

The [scripts](scripts) directory will contain (optional) scripts used by the Jenkinsfiles.  

The [docs](docs) directory will cover more information about how the server was installed, and about specific repositories and jobs.
